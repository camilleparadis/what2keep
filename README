Prettier
Prettier is used in this project to enforce consistent code style to increase readability/maintainability.

The Prettier extension can be installed in VSCode by searching for prettier and installing it under extensions.

Ensure that "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode" is in VSCode settings to allow prettier to be the formatter.
"editor.formatOnSave": true, is another settings that may be added to ensure that whenever a file is saved it will be made to comply with the prettier settings. These settings can be found in the .prettierrc file.
