# What2Keep: An easy way to track your things and reduce your stuff

What2Keep is a mobile app for iOS and Android focused on the wellness of having stuff, specifically keeping track of it and getting rid of it.

## Installation

Download all of the source code, and in both ./What2Keep and ./expressjs-backend, install with the node package manager

```bash
cd What2Keep
npm install
cd ..
cd expressjs-backend
npm install
```

## How to Use

What2Keep runs on React Native and ExpoGo. Launching the app takes two steps
### 1.
Launch the Backend:
In the subdirectory ./expressjs-backend

```bash
npm run start
```

Proper response should say
```bash
REST API is listening.
```

### 2.
Launch the Frontend:
Navigate back and into the subdirectory ./What2Keep and run

```bash
npm run start
```

Expo should launch, and a QR Code should appear to scan with a mobile phone. Alternatively you may choose to use an android or iOS simulator to launch expo.
